# Homework:


### Task A:

Write a Java program that prompts the user to input 10 integers into an array and then calculates and 
prints out the sum and average of the elements in the array.

***Example:***
```bash
userInput[] = {5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 77, 99}
The SUM of array elements: 272
The AVERAGE of array elements: 27.0
```
### Task B:

Write a Java program that declares and initializes an array of integers with the values {3, 6, 9, 12, 15} and 
then prints out the values in the array in reverse order.

```bash
reversedArray[] = {15, 12, 9, 6, 3}
```
